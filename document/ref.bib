	abstract = {In the early 1980s, Discourse Representation Theory ({DRT)} wasintroduced by Hans Kamp as a theoretical framework for dealing withissues in the semantics and pragmatics of anaphora and tense (Kamp1981); a very similar theory  wasdeveloped independently by Irene Heim (1982). The distinctive featuresof {DRT}, to be discussed below, are that it is a mentalist andrepresentationalist theory of interpretation, and that it is a theoryof the interpretation not only of individual sentences but ofdiscourse, as well. In these respects {DRT} made a clear break withclassical formal semantics, which during the 1970s had emanated {fromMontague's} pioneering work (Thomason 1974), but in other respects itcontinued the tradition, e.g. in its use of model-theoreticaltools. In the meantime, {DRT} has come to serve as a framework forexplaining a wide range of phenomena, but we will confine ourattention to three: anaphora, presupposition, and tense.

An explosion of Web-based language techniques, merging of distinct fields, availability of phone-based dialogue systems, and much more make this an exciting time in speech and language processing. the first of its kind to thoroughly cover language technology at all levels and with all modern technologies this text takes an empirical approach to the subject, based on applying statistical and other machine-learning algorithms to large corporations. the authors cover areas that traditionally are taught in different courses, to describe a unified vision of speech and language processing. Emphasis is on practical applications and scientific evaluation. an accompanying Website contains teaching materials for instructors, with pointers to language processing resources on the Web. the Second Edition offers a significant amount of new and extended material.

  abstract = {Theoretical results suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need {\insist deep architectures}. Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas. This paper discusses the motivations and principles regarding learning algorithms for deep architectures, in particular those exploiting as building blocks unsupervised learning of single-layer models such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines, used to construct deeper models such as Deep Belief Networks.}
